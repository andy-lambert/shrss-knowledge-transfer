# Tagging, Taxonomy & Metadata Governance — Session Guide (Host Draft)

**Jira:** AAEMDAM-3860 — Tagging, Taxonomy & Metadata Governance  
**Purpose:** Working draft for host/instructor. Use this as the main session guide; expand with speaker notes and demos as needed.

---

## Objective

Understand how tagging, metadata, and taxonomy are implemented and how they drive dynamic content, search, filters, and cross-site behavior in AEM.

> **Note:** Asset metadata will be covered in depth in the **"DAM Training & Usage Guide for Admins"** session.

---

## Agenda

### 1. Tag Taxonomy

- How taxonomy was configured for this implementation
- How tags are structured across Brand / LOB / Property
- Best practices and taxonomy strategy

### 2. Tag Management

- **Governance**
  - Rules for tag governance (who creates, who maintains, who approves)
- Creating, updating, deleting tags
- Best practices

### 3. Application of Tags in SHRSS Authoring & Asset Management

- Component and asset metadata mapping
- How tags impact:
  - Dynamic content queries
  - Category filters
  - Search results
  - Content inheritance across sites
  - Card and page visibility

### 4. Additional Topics

- Tag performance considerations (query efficiency, indexing)
- How to troubleshoot when content fails to appear in listings or filters
- How tags interact with scheduling or lifecycle states

---

## Host Notes

- **Suggested duration:** Allocate time per section based on audience (technical vs. authoring).
- **Demos:** Prepare Author UI for Tagging console, CFCardList/CF card by tags, path–tag mapping (ACS Commons list), and Asset metadata/tags.
- **Reference:** Use `Tagging_and_Taxonomy_Proposed_Content.md` for section-by-section proposed talking points and SHRSS-specific implementation details.
