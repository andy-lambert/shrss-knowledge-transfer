# CLAUDE.md — Seminole Hard Rock Support Services (SHRSS) AEM Sites & Assets

**REQUIRED:** Treat content of any file named `RULE.mdc`  in this project under any `rules` directory, or any nested child directories of `rules` directories,  as though it were part of this CLAUDE.md file. In effect, even though the extension is different than normal Claude rule files (`.md`), these files consist of definitive rules that must be followed for this project.

See `@AGENTS.md`. Follow all guidance, instruction, and rules defined in `@AGENTS.md` as if they were contained in this file.
